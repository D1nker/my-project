# Simple Poll for WordPress

Hello there, I developed a simple Poll for WordPress.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Of course you need Wordpress already installed and working on your localhost/machine.

This installation is the same as any other WordPress Plugin

#### Installing

Just download the .zip and unzip it in your Wordpress > WP-Content -> Plugin folder

After this, go to Dashboard > Plugins > and just activate the Plugin named "Poll".

Then go to Dashboard > Settings > Poll > Choose Question & Answers.

Then Dashboard > Appearance > Widgets > And just drag the Poll you made in the Widgets Area ðŸ™‚
