## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.
I'll upload some screenshots as soon as possible.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.
To install my plugin, it's simple as hello, just you need to download the .zip or clone it into your git repository,
and then just extract it into your plugin folders of wordpress/wp-content

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

I'll upload some screenshots as soon as possible too.
